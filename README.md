## Description  
This application is a web service with live polling aimed at assisting education. The main goal is to have students write down their questions. These questions will be reflected on a public board for that classroom allowing other  students from the same class up-vote a question and give it more relevance so the teacher can answer the most pressing matters.

## User Story
Questions are used as an anonymous way to get students to open up about their doubts and having other people back them up if they have the same issue. Teachers choose solving those questions based now on relevance and how many students they could affect positively in the process. This helps teachers poll how many people grasp the knowledge they are imparting and can help them change the structure of their future classes based on that information
